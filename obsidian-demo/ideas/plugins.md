# Plugins

Obsidian can be extended with plugins. There are core plugins, which come with Obsidian, and community plugins, which are made by the community and not officially supported. Several core plugins are available by default, and can be enabled or disabled according to your needs.

You can find both core and community plugins under the settings. If you want a detailed breakdown on the core plugins, see the [official help vault](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian%20Help&file=Plugins%2FCore%20plugins) (requires having opened the "Help" vault at least once).
