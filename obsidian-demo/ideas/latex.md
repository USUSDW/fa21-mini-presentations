# LaTeX

Who could forget one of the best parts of Obsidian? It has [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions) support! If you need to write out math equations, Obsidian has you covered. You can do both inline math, and block math.

The LaTeX engine Obsidian uses is [Mathjax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/basic/mathjax.html).

## Inline Math

To write math inline, simply open and close the LaTeX syntax with a `$`. For example: $e = mc^2$.

## Block Math

Block math is simply puts your math into a block and centers it. Like inline math, simply open and close the LaTeX syntax with `$$`. For example:

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}

0 & x < -1\\\\
\frac{20}{38} & -1 \le x < 1\\\\
1 & x \ge 1

\end{cases}
$$

$$

\begin{equation*}

e = mc^2

\end{equation*}
