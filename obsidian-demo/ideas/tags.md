# Tags

Tags are simply used as a way to organize and quickly find files. They are added by prefixing the tag with a `#`. For example, one tag I use frequently for school work is `#definition`, so I can quickly find all definitions if needs be.

Tags can be added anywhere in the file, or in the [[metadata]] for a file.

By default, there is a *Tags* pane on the right where you can view all tags.
